# Introduction 
This project uses dual quaternions to represent and transform manufactured parts and fixtures. The purpose is to predict the geometry of manufactured parts in multistage machining processes given locating surface and machining deviations. The implementation uses a two stationed machining line to demonstrate the idea.  

# Additional Libraries
The code is dependent on the libraries below.
